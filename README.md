Evaluation of Figures Used in Diagnosis in Neurology.
This is the outcome of me wanting to learn Word2Vec.

## How this repo is structured

* [notebooks](notebooks/) contains python notebooks I used while learning about Word2Vec. I went into this project with the intention of these being shareable so others could look through and understand the different concepts I learned along the way.
